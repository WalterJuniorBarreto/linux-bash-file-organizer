#  Linux File Organizer

Automated Bash script to organize files based on their extensions. Designed to keep directories clean and structured.

##  Features
- **Smart Sorting:** Automatically moves files into `Imagenes`, `Documentos`, `Ejecutables`, and `Otros`.
- **Safety First:** Uses `mv -n` to prevent data overwriting.
- **Case Insensitive:** Recognizes `.jpg` and `.JPG` as the same type.
- **Self-Preservation:** The script excludes itself from being moved.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
